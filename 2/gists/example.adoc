= DocGist

toc::[]

DocGist is a URL proxy tool that converts http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc] documents fetched from Gists (http://gist.github.com), GitHub repositories, Dropbox folders and other sources to HTML.
The conversion to HTML is performed in the browser (client-side) using the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[Asciidoctor.js] JavaScript library.
DocGist can render documents located anywhere, as long as the host permits cross-domain access.

[NOTE]
DocGist uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/releases/tag/v1.5.3[latest release (1.5.3)] of Asciidoctor.
If you want to use the syntax of older versions, add `:compat-mode:` to the document header.
There's more information on this in the link:./?github-asciidoctor%2Fasciidoctor.org%2F%2Fdocs%2Fmigration.adoc[migration guide].

The original idea and code for DocGist came from http://gist.neo4j.org[GraphGist].
GraphGist is an interactive documentation tool for the Neo4j database and Cypher query language.

== How To Use

* Create/locate a gist on GitHub (or use a file in Dropbox).
** Write text using AsciiDoc syntax in it.
** Save it.
* Enter the URL (or id) of the gist in the form on top of this page and hit Enter on your keyboard.
* The page is rendered.
* Share the URL with others so they can read the page.

== Images

Relative image URLs are resolved to the same location as the document.
If the images are located elsewhere, use the `imagesdir` attribute to point out the location.
See the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#set-the-images-directory[Asciidoctor user manual] for the details.
There's also an link:./?github-asciidoctor%2Fdocgist%2F%2Fgists%2Fimages.adoc[image example].

----
image::sunset.jpg[]
----

Is rendered as:

image::sunset.jpg[]

== Table of contents

To add a table of contents, put this in the place you want it to appear:

--
 toc::[]
--

== Source code highlighting

By default, source code is highlighted using https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js].
Simply include the source code like this:

--
 [source,ruby]
 .app.rb
 ----
 require 'sinatra'
 get '/hi' do
   "Hello World!"
 end
 ----
--

This is how it gets rendered:

[source,ruby]
.app.rb
----
require 'sinatra'
get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
----

https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/[Prettify] is supported as well.
See the link:./?github-asciidoctor%2Fdocgist%2F%2Fgists%2Fprettify.adoc[Prettify example] for how to activate it.

You can also choose to use https://codemirror.net/[CodeMirror], see the link:./?github-asciidoctor%2Fdocgist%2F%2Fgists%2Fcodemirror.adoc[CodeMirror example].

NOTE: Only one source highlighter can be defined per document when using DocGist.

[CAUTION]
.Experimental Features in DocGist
====
* Highlighting can be used inline as well, for example `[src-ruby]`do`` renders like: [src-ruby]`do`.
* Multiple code snippets in different languages can be combined into a tabbed view.
  See the link:./?github-asciidoctor%2Fdocgist%2F%2Fgists%2Ftabbed-source.adoc[Tabbed Source] example for more information.
====

== Math

Thanks to https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] mathematical expressions can be typeset in DocGist documents.

For block content, do like this:

--
 [stem]
 ++++
 sqrt(4) = 2
 ++++
--

It will render like below:

[stem]
++++
sqrt(4) = 2
++++

You can use it inline as well, for example:

--
 Water (stem:[H_2O]) is a critical component.
--

Which renders like this: Water (stem:[H_2O]) is a critical component.

== Tips and tricks

Links to other DocGists can use this syntax: `+link:./?5897167[DocGist intro]+` which renders as link:./?5897167[DocGist intro].
This makes things easier in case you run DocGist locally to fiddle with the "`backend`" (it's a frontend really).

You can view the source Gist of this page by clicking on the green button in the navbar.

How about some UML?
The following image is included using the syntax `image::http://yuml.me/c9ce39b0.png[]`.

image::http://yuml.me/c9ce39b0.png[]

The URL is a reference to a yUML image.
yUML is tool for creating UML diagrams online.
