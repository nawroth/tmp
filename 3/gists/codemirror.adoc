= Using CodeMirror

:source-highlighter: codemirror

To activate support for http://codemirror.net/[CodeMirror] add the following to the document header:

----
:source-highlighter: codemirror
----

Then simply include the source code like this:

--
 [source,ruby]
 .app.rb
 ----
 require 'sinatra'
 get '/hi' do
   "Hello World!"
 end
 ----
--

This is how it gets rendered:

[source,ruby]
.app.rb
----
require 'sinatra'
get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
----

If you highlight http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/[Cypher] code, its special theme kicks in here on DocGist:

[source,cypher]
.Create a movie node
----
CREATE (:Movie { title:"The Matrix",released:1997 })
----

[CAUTION]
.Experimental
====
Highighting can be used inline as well, for example `[src-cypher]`CREATE`` renders like: [src-cypher]`CREATE`.
This is a feature of DocGist.
